// WAV parsing and resampling for play_wav, shared by both audio backends.
//
// The simulator / Retro machines mix PCM here and the Modern firmware mixes
// it in fmruby-core (main/drivers/audio_p4), so this file is duplicated there
// (components/fmrb_audio/fmrb_wav.h + .c) the same way audio_commands.h is.
// Keep the copies identical apart from that note: a resampler that disagrees
// between the two would change the pitch depending on which machine played
// the file.
//
// What is NOT here, on purpose: opening the file and allocating the samples.
// The two sides prefix paths differently ("/flash" vs "flash") and allocate
// from different heaps, so each owns its loader and hands the bytes here.
